# How to deploy a new version

- For the Web extension, just commit the file `build/web-extension-latest.xpi`

- For the EMT plugin, commit the file `build/emt-plugin-latest.tar.gz` (without any folder inside)

- It is also considered best practice to keep all the specific versions, for example:
    - web-extension-1.2.1.xpi
    - emt-plugin-0.6.3.tar.gz
